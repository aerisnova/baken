**What you prep in rekordbox is what plays on the deck.**

rekordbox does three things in software that never survive the trip to a CDJ. Bake'n Deck bakes each one into the files themselves:

| Subcommand | The gap it fills | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [`baken headroom`](#loudness-normalizer-baken-headroom) | Auto Gain is ignored on USB export | Measures LUFS / True Peak and bakes safe gain into the audio file — **no limiter**, dynamics preserved, cues stay linked |
| [`baken rbsort`](#rekordbox-playlist-sorter-baken-rbsort) | No compound Key+BPM sort in rekordbox | Sorts every playlist by **Alphanumeric key (1A→12B) then BPM** inside your exported XML — CDJs play it in that exact order |
| [`baken cdjsafe`](#cdj-safe-transcoder-baken-cdjsafe) | Pre-NXS2 CDJs only play MP3 reliably | Transcodes a whole playlist to **320 kbps CBR MP3** with **cues and beatgrid carried over** — the emergency-backup USB |
| [`baken expressport`](#direct-usb-export-baken-expressport) | Exporting to USB means launching rekordbox and waiting | **Writes the stick directly** from `collection.xml`: device library, analysis files, audio, My Settings |

## Bake'n Deck for Mac

[**Bake'n Deck for Mac**](https://apps.apple.com/app/baken-deck/id6808813823) is the native app edition, on the Mac App Store. The same `baken-core` engine and the same numbers, in a window: Headroom for a whole folder or for a single rekordbox playlist, with a review table and audio preview; a sorted-order preview before Sort writes anything; a CDJ Safe pre-flight check; USB Export, which writes the stick from your collection XML with the same code as `baken expressport`, with a pre-flight and a report; per-run timestamped backups with one-click restore; and Mac Tune-up for the macOS settings that slow rekordbox down. One-time purchase, no subscription, no account, no network access. English and Japanese, macOS 14 or later, Apple silicon and Intel.

The `baken` command line stays free and MIT-licensed on macOS, Windows and Linux, and always will.

If rekordbox is slow on your Mac, the five macOS settings behind most of it are written up in [docs/mac-tuneup.md](docs/mac-tuneup.md), with the manual steps ([日本語版](docs/mac-tuneup.ja.md)). No tool required, and nothing to buy.

## Installation

The Mac app bundles its own ffmpeg, so there is nothing else to install. The command line requires ffmpeg; package managers install it automatically.

| Platform | Command |
|----------|---------|
| **macOS (Homebrew)** | `brew install M-Igashi/tap/baken` |
| **Windows (winget)** | `winget install M-Igashi.baken` |
| **Arch Linux (AUR)** | `yay -S baken-bin` |
| **Cargo** | `cargo install baken` (ffmpeg must be installed separately) |

Pre-built binaries are available on the [Releases](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/releases) page (ffmpeg must be installed separately). To build from source: `git clone https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken.git && cd baken && cargo build --release`.

The processing logic is a separate library crate, [`baken-core`](https://crates.io/crates/baken-core), so other front-ends can embed it without the terminal UI.

## Quick Start

```bash
baken headroom ~/Music/DJ-Tracks                # analyze & bake loudness gain (interactive)
baken rbsort collection.xml                     # sort every playlist by Key+BPM, in place
baken cdjsafe collection.xml --playlist "Sets/Friday" --out-dir ~/Music/cdjsafe
```

Run `baken --help` or `baken <subcommand> --help` for the full reference.

> [!NOTE]
> **Renamed from `headroom` at v3.0.0** ([#60](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/60)). The old `headroom` install channels (brew/winget/cargo/AUR) no longer receive updates — reinstall via the `baken` packages above. The loudness analyzer now lives under the `baken headroom` subcommand.

## Highlights

- **Single binary** — [mp3rgain](https://github.com/M-Igashi/mp3rgain) built in; only ffmpeg required (and `rbsort` doesn't even need that)
- **Truly lossless MP3/AAC gain** — global_gain header modification in 1.5 dB steps, no re-encode
- **Uniform True Peak ceiling** — every track lands at -0.5 dBTP by default (AES TD1008 §7B): quiet tracks are raised, loud ones lowered. Tunable via `--tp-target`, or `--boost-only` to never turn anything down
- **Non-destructive** — automatic backups; `rbsort`/`cdjsafe` only ever touch an exported XML, never your rekordbox library
- **Metadata preserved** — files overwritten in place and every tag carried across verbatim, so rekordbox cues, hot cues, and beatgrids stay linked
- **Interactive or scriptable** — guided two-stage confirmation, or flags/globs for pipelines and CI

## Loudness Normalizer (`baken headroom`)

### How It Works

1. Scans the target directory for audio files (FLAC, AIFF, WAV, MP3, AAC/M4A, ALAC/M4A)
2. Measures LUFS (Integrated Loudness) and True Peak per ITU-R BS.1770-4, decoding in-process (ffmpeg is used for files the built-in decoder cannot open). A file that does not decode cleanly is reported as damaged and left alone (see [Damaged Files](#damaged-files))
3. Computes the gain that puts each file's True Peak at the ceiling (-0.5 dBTP by default). Quiet files get a positive gain, loud files a negative one; `--boost-only` restricts this to positive gains.
4. Categorizes files by processing method:
   - **Green**: Lossless files (ffmpeg)
   - **Yellow**: MP3/AAC files with enough headroom for native lossless gain
   - MP3/AAC files already within one 1.5 dB step of the ceiling are left alone: nothing is re-encoded to move a file by less than a step
5. Displays categorized report
6. Confirmation: "Apply lossless gain adjustment?" (lossless + native MP3/AAC)
7. Creates backups and processes files

### Usage

#### Interactive Mode

Run `baken headroom` without further arguments to use the guided workflow in the current directory:

```bash
cd ~/Music/DJ-Tracks
baken headroom
```

The tool will guide you through:
1. Scanning and analyzing all audio files
2. Reviewing the categorized report
3. Confirming lossless processing
4. Creating backups (recommended)

#### Scriptable Mode

Pass paths, globs, or flags to run non-interactively (useful for pipelines and scripts):

```bash
# Analyze a directory without modifying anything
baken headroom --analyze-only ~/Music/DJ-Tracks

# Apply only lossless gain, with backup, save report to a specific path
baken headroom --lossless --backup ./bak --report results.csv ./album/

# Operate on specific files
baken headroom --lossless track1.mp3 track2.flac

# Glob patterns
baken headroom --lossless --no-report "./music/**/*.mp3"

# Tighter ceiling for streaming-platform delivery (Spotify / Apple / YouTube max)
baken headroom --lossless --tp-target -1.0 ./album/

# Restore the legacy bitrate-dependent split (pre-v1.10 behaviour)
baken headroom --lossless --tp-split-bitrate ./album/

# Only raise quiet tracks, never lower loud ones (pre-v3.3 behaviour)
baken headroom --lossless --boost-only ./album/
```

**Non-interactive defaults** (when any flag or path is provided):
- `--lossless` is **on** unless `--no-lossless`
- `--reencode` and `--no-reencode` are accepted for compatibility and do nothing: no file is re-encoded for gain
- `--backup` is **off** unless provided; bare `--backup` uses `<target>/backup`
- CSV report is written unless `--no-report`; `--report PATH` sets a custom location
- `--analyze-only` runs analysis + report only, skips processing
- `--boost-only` skips files above the ceiling instead of lowering them

Run `baken headroom --help` for the full flag reference.

### Processing Methods

baken selects the optimal method for each file based on format and headroom:

| Format | Method | Precision | Quality Loss |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|
| FLAC, AIFF, WAV | ffmpeg | Arbitrary | None |
| MP3, AAC/M4A | mp3rgain (built-in) | 1.5dB steps | **None** (global_gain modification) |
| ALAC/M4A | ffmpeg (re-encoded as ALAC) | Arbitrary | **None** (lossless codec) |

A lossy file closer to the ceiling than one 1.5 dB step is left alone rather than re-encoded, so no MP3 or AAC ever loses a generation to a gain change.

Lossless files are written back in their **original sample format** — a 16-bit AIFF stays 16-bit, a 32-bit float WAV stays 32-bit float — so file size does not grow and float masters are not truncated. FLAC is the one partial exception: ffmpeg's FLAC encoder only accepts 16- and 24-bit output, so an 8-bit FLAC becomes 16-bit and a 20-bit FLAC becomes 24-bit.

A WAV keeps its header form too. ffmpeg writes `WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE` for integer PCM deeper than 16 bits and for anything faster than 48 kHz, so a plain WAV, the way DAWs and download stores write it, gets its own `fmt ` chunk back after the rewrite and reads the same in `baken cdjsafe --check` before and after a run ([#218](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/218)).

#### Raising and Lowering

The gain for each file is `ceiling − measured True Peak`. Files below the ceiling get a positive gain, files above it (loudness-war masters, inter-sample overs from lossy encoding) get a negative one, so every track ends up at the same True Peak with no limiter involved. Pass `--boost-only` to keep the pre-v3.3 behaviour of raising quiet files only and leaving loud files untouched.

#### Damaged Files

A file with audio frames the decoder rejects is reported as damaged, with the number of frames and where the first one is, and gets no gain. So does a file that measures above 0 LUFS or +20 dBTP, a level no real file reaches. The numbers of such a file describe what the decoder made of the damage, not the music: an AAC whose last two and a half minutes are corrupt measured +22.3 LUFS and +37.6 dBTP through ffmpeg, and up to 4.4.0 it was offered -39 dB, which would have left the track almost silent ([#223](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/223)). The damaged part may also play as a burst of noise on a player, so replace the file from its source; rekordbox analyses such a file without complaint. The terminal lists every damaged file with its full path, and the CSV report names the reason in its `Damage` column.

#### Two-Tier Approach for Lossy Formats (MP3/AAC)

Each MP3 and AAC/M4A file is categorized into one of two tiers:

1. **Native Lossless** — the gain is at least one 1.5 dB step in either direction
   - Truly lossless global_gain header modification in 1.5dB steps
   - Uses built-in [mp3rgain](https://github.com/M-Igashi/mp3rgain) library
   - Raising rounds down to whole steps (never overshoots the ceiling); lowering rounds up (the result never exceeds the ceiling, e.g. TP +0.3 dBTP → -1.5 dB → -1.2 dBTP)
   - Applied automatically (no user confirmation needed)

2. **Skip** — True Peak within 0.05 dB of the ceiling; a lossy file less than one 1.5 dB step below it; or above the ceiling with `--boost-only`
   - A raise smaller than one step could only be applied by re-encoding, and a lossy generation to move a file already within 1.5 dB of the ceiling is not a trade worth making
   - It is also exactly where every lossy file lands after a native step, since lowering rounds up. Re-encoding there meant offering a third of a processed library up for another lossy generation on every later run ([#138](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/138))
   - Lowering never re-encodes either: small overshoots take one full native step instead

### True Peak Ceiling

#### Default — uniform delivery target

Every file targets **-0.5 dBTP** by default. This is the maximum-aggression value that [AES TD1008](https://www.aes.org/technical/documentDownloads.cfm?docID=731) §7B describes for high-rate codec inputs ("may work satisfactorily with as little as -0.5 dBTP for the limiting threshold").

| File class | Ceiling | Native lossless raise requires |
|---|---|---|
| Lossless (FLAC, AIFF, WAV) | **-0.5 dBTP** | — |
| MP3 (any bitrate) | **-0.5 dBTP** | TP ≤ -2.0 dBTP (any TP above the ceiling is lowered natively) |
| AAC/M4A (any bitrate) | **-0.5 dBTP** | TP ≤ -2.0 dBTP (any TP above the ceiling is lowered natively) |

#### Why a single ceiling — pre-encode vs delivery

TD1008 has two related but distinct numbers:

1. **Generic delivery recommendation (§4)** — "Maximum True Peak level not exceed -1 dBTP at the codec input of lossy-encoded streams." This is the *pre-encode* limiter threshold.
2. **High-rate codec relaxation (§7B)** — "High-rate (e.g., 256 kbps) coders may work satisfactorily with as little as -0.5 dBTP" — also a *codec-input* threshold; "the limiting threshold may need to be reduced below the recommended -1.0 dBTP" for lower bit rates.

Both bullets describe the *limiter that sits in front of the encoder*. baken operates in the opposite position: on **already-encoded delivery files**. There is no further codec stage downstream to absorb additional overshoot, so the bitrate-dependent slack TD1008 grants the pre-encode limiter does not transfer to the end product. A single, codec-agnostic delivery ceiling is the correct interpretation. -0.5 dBTP is chosen because it is the most aggressive value TD1008 sanctions for any limiter in the chain; lossless and high-rate lossy files were already at -0.5, and low-rate files now stop giving up an unnecessary 0.5 dB of loudness.

See [docs/true-peak-ceiling.md](docs/true-peak-ceiling.md) for a longer walk-through with citations.

#### Tuning the ceiling

| Goal | Flag | Resulting ceiling |
|---|---|---|
| Default (max-aggressive delivery) | *(none)* | -0.5 dBTP for all files |
| Match Spotify / Apple Music / YouTube delivery max | `--tp-target -1.0` | -1.0 dBTP for all files |
| Conservative master with extra player headroom | `--tp-target -2.0` | -2.0 dBTP for all files |
| Mirror TD1008's pre-encode interpretation | `--tp-split-bitrate` | -0.5 dBTP ≥256 kbps, -1.0 dBTP <256 kbps |

`--tp-target` and `--tp-split-bitrate` are mutually exclusive. `--tp-split-bitrate` reproduces the pre-1.10 default exactly.

The native-lossless raise threshold scales with the chosen ceiling: it is always `target − 1.5 dB` (e.g. `-0.5` → TP ≤ -2.0; `-1.0` → TP ≤ -2.5; `-2.0` → TP ≤ -3.5). Files above the ceiling are always lowered natively.

### Notes & Technical Details

- **Files are overwritten in place** after backup — rekordbox metadata remains linked
- **Analyse processed FLAC files again in rekordbox before a USB export from rekordbox.** headroom re-encodes FLAC, which moves every frame, and rekordbox copies the seek table of its earlier analysis onto the stick unchanged, so the player's table no longer points at the frames ([#219](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/219)). `baken expressport` rebuilds the table from the file itself. Only FLAC analyses carry such a table, and MP3 and AAC are adjusted in place
- **Tags survive the rewrite**: MP3/AAC native gain never rewrites the container, and where ffmpeg does (the lossless formats) the source's raw tags are put back over the output byte for byte. That covers the payloads DJ software writes and ffmpeg has nowhere to put: ID3v2 `GEOB`/`PRIV` frames on MP3, AIFF and WAV, and free-form `----` atoms on ALAC and AAC in `.m4a` ([#117](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/117)). A WAV's Broadcast Wave `bext` chunk (description, originator, dates, time reference) goes back the same way, which ffmpeg would write with the description, originator and dates blank; only BWF v2 loudness values are left out, since the gain changes them ([#218](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/218))
- Only files whose True Peak is **more than 0.05 dB away from the ceiling** are shown and processed
- MP3/AAC native lossless raising requires at least **1.5dB headroom**; lowering always uses whole native steps
- MP3/AAC files closer to the ceiling than one step are left alone; nothing is re-encoded for gain
- macOS resource fork files (`._*`) are automatically ignored

#### Why 1.5dB Steps?

Both MP3 and AAC store a "global_gain" value as an integer. Each ±1 increment changes the gain by `2^(1/4)` = **±1.5 dB**. This is a format-level constraint, not a tool limitation.

baken uses the built-in [mp3rgain](https://github.com/M-Igashi/mp3rgain) library to directly modify this field — no decoding or re-encoding involved.

#### Native Lossless Threshold

Since native lossless gain only works in 1.5 dB steps, raising a file requires at least 1.5 dB of headroom to the configured target ceiling. The threshold scales automatically:

| Target | Requires TP ≤ |
|---|---|
| -0.5 dBTP (default) | -2.0 dBTP |
| -1.0 dBTP (`--tp-target -1.0`) | -2.5 dBTP |
| -2.0 dBTP (`--tp-target -2.0`) | -3.5 dBTP |

Example: 320 kbps file at -3.5 dBTP, default target → 2 steps (+3.0 dB) → -0.5 dBTP (optimal).

Lowering has no such threshold: a file at +0.3 dBTP takes one step down (-1.5 dB) and lands at -1.2 dBTP, slightly under the ceiling rather than re-encoded to hit it exactly.

#### Why files under the threshold are left alone

A lossy file within one step of the ceiling can only be moved by re-encoding it, and that costs a generation of quality to gain less than 1.5 dB. It is also where every file ends up after a native step, so re-encoding there would mean re-encoding a large part of the library again on every later run. Both directions therefore stop at whole steps, and a run over a library that has already been processed finds nothing left to do.

## rekordbox Playlist Sorter (`baken rbsort`)

rekordbox does not expose a "sort by Key AND BPM" option in its UI. `baken rbsort` takes an exported rekordbox XML and rewrites every playlist in it so its tracks run **Alphanumeric key (1A → 12B) ascending** then **BPM ascending**. Playlists keep their names and folder positions; only the track order inside each one changes. rekordbox reads the sorted file back as its `rekordbox xml` tree, so you end up with a Key+BPM-sorted mirror of your `Playlists` sitting next to the originals.

This is the same idea as `baken headroom` applied to playlist order: rekordbox's software-only features (Auto Gain, multi-column sort) don't follow your tracks to the CDJ. `rbsort` bakes Key+BPM order into the playlist itself — so when you export to USB in rekordbox's EXPORT mode, the CDJ plays the set in that exact order with no on-deck reordering.

Step-by-step, with the sort rules, a comparison against single-column sort and the questions people ask: **[How to sort a rekordbox playlist by key and BPM](https://baken.ravers.workers.dev/sort)** ([日本語](https://baken.ravers.workers.dev/ja/sort)).

### Workflow

1. **Export**: *File > Export Collection in xml format*. Always save to the same path, e.g. `~/Music/rekordbox/collection.xml`. Either key display format works (*Preferences > View > Key display format*, Classic or Alphanumeric); the order is the same.
2. **Run rbsort** on that file. It is sorted in place:
   ```bash
   baken rbsort ~/Music/rekordbox/collection.xml

   # Only one playlist (top-level: just the name; nested: "Folder/Playlist")
   baken rbsort ~/Music/rekordbox/collection.xml --playlist "Sets/Friday"

   # Keep the export untouched and write elsewhere
   baken rbsort ~/Music/rekordbox/collection.xml -o ~/Music/rekordbox/sorted.xml
   ```
3. **One-time setup**: *Preferences > Advanced > Database > rekordbox xml > Imported Library* → select that same file.
4. **Restart rekordbox** (it only re-reads the XML on startup) and open the **`rekordbox xml` tree** in the left sidebar. It is a *separate* tree from your main library — switch to it from the sidebar icon column on the far left. It mirrors your `Playlists` folder structure, every playlist already in Key+BPM order: `1A` (lowest BPM) → `1B` → `2A` → … → `12B` (highest BPM).
5. **Use it**: drag any playlist from the `rekordbox xml` tree into your main `Playlists` (it lands as a new playlist; your original is unchanged), switch to *EXPORT* mode, plug in your USB / SD, then **right-click the playlist → Export Playlist**. CDJs read tracks in playlist order by default — your Key+BPM sort plays back on the deck in that exact order.

**Keeping it in sync**: whenever your playlists change, repeat steps 1, 2 and the restart. The file path never changes, so the Imported Library setting keeps pointing at the freshly sorted export and the `rekordbox xml` tree stays an always-sorted copy of your library.

> The sorted playlists live **only** in the `rekordbox xml` tree, not in your main `Playlists`. If you only see unsorted originals, you're looking at the local library — switch sidebar trees.

### Usage

```
baken rbsort <XML> [--playlist <PATH>] [-o <PATH>]
```

| Argument / Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `<XML>` | Exported rekordbox XML (required). Sorted in place unless `--output` is given; the file is replaced in one step (temp file + rename), so an interrupted run never leaves a truncated XML |
| `--playlist <PATH>` | Sort only this playlist. Top-level playlists: just the name (e.g. `"Happy House and Trance"`). Nested: `/`-separate folder/playlist names (e.g. `"Folder/SubFolder/MyPlaylist"`). Omitted: every TrackID-referenced playlist is sorted |
| `--output <PATH>` (`-o`) | Write the result here instead of overwriting the input XML |

### Sort Rules

- **Primary**: Alphanumeric key ascending — `1A → 1B → 2A → 2B → … → 12A → 12B`
- **Secondary**: BPM ascending within each key group
- Tracks with no key sort **after** all known keys; within a key group, tracks with BPM 0 / unanalyzed sort last

See [docs/rbsort-sort-comparison.md](docs/rbsort-sort-comparison.md) for a 6-track walk-through showing how this compound sort differs from rekordbox / CDJ's single-column *Sort by Key* and *Sort by BPM*. The same walk-through, with the workflow around it, is at [baken.ravers.workers.dev/sort](https://baken.ravers.workers.dev/sort).

### Notes

- The `Tonality` field may be in either of rekordbox's key display formats: Alphanumeric (`8A`) or Classic (`Am`, `F#m`, `Db`). A Classic key sorts at its Alphanumeric position (`Am` with `8A`, `C` with `8B`). Anything else is sorted last.
- Only `KeyType="0"` (TrackID-referenced) playlists are sorted. In all-playlists mode, other playlists pass through unchanged; for a single target, `rbsort` errors out.
- Only the order of `<TRACK Key="…"/>` references changes. Playlist names, folder structure, `Count`/`Entries` attributes, whitespace and everything else in the XML are preserved byte-for-byte, so running `rbsort` twice on the same file is a no-op.
- `baken rbsort` does **not** require ffmpeg — only the `headroom` and `cdjsafe` subcommands do.

## CDJ-safe Transcoder (`baken cdjsafe`)

*Added in v3.0.0. Design discussion: [#40](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/40).*

Pre-NXS2 CDJs (CDJ-2000NXS, CDJ-2000, CDJ-900NXS, CDJ-850, …) have inconsistent or absent support for anything that isn't MP3: FLAC needs an NXS2 (2016+), and ALAC/AIFF/WAV/AAC fail on specific firmware combinations — sometimes mid-set. `baken cdjsafe` is the emergency-backup path: it takes a gig playlist and produces a USB-ready set of files that **will play on any CDJ**, with your cues and beatgrid intact.

```bash
baken cdjsafe ~/Music/rekordbox/collection.xml \
  --playlist "Sets/Friday" \
  --out-dir ~/Music/cdjsafe-friday
```

### What it does

1. Reads the target playlist from your exported `collection.xml`.
2. Converts every track whose file exists to the CDJ-safe profile. Tracks whose files are missing on disk, or whose `Location` is not a decodable `file://` URL (a hand-edited row), are listed as skipped with the reason and left out (the emergency stick still gets everything that is there); only a playlist with nothing reachable at all is an error. Profile: — **320 kbps CBR MP3 @ 44.1 kHz**, ID3v2.3 tags, artwork kept (JPEG, capped at 500×500):

   | Source | Action |
   |---|---|
   | FLAC, WAV, AIFF, ALAC | Re-encode |
   | AAC/M4A (any bitrate) | Re-encode |
   | MP3 not exactly 320 kbps CBR @ 44.1 kHz | Re-encode (lossy→lossy, reported) |
   | MP3 already 320 kbps CBR @ 44.1 kHz | **Byte-identical copy** (no generation loss, LAME header untouched) |

3. Emits an updated XML (default: `<input>-out.xml`) where each converted track is a **new entry with a fresh TrackID** that inherits the source's beatgrid (`TEMPO`) and hot/memory cues (`POSITION_MARK`) **verbatim**, grouped in a `CDJ-safe (MP3)/<playlist>-CDJ-safe` folder. The `-CDJ-safe` suffix keeps the imported playlist from colliding with the original. New entries get a `[cdjsafe]` marker appended to their Comments so they're distinguishable after import.
4. Reports every lossy→lossy re-encode so you can refresh those tracks from lossless masters before the next gig.

If any track fails to convert, **no XML is written** — a partial USB defeats the point. The XML is written through a temp file and a rename, so an interrupted run never leaves a truncated file either. The same applies if the collection XML changed while the transcodes ran (a rekordbox export made mid-run): the MP3s already converted are kept and the command tells you to re-run, which only copies them.

### Importing back into rekordbox

1. *Preferences > Advanced > Database > rekordbox xml > Imported Library* → select the output XML, restart rekordbox.
2. Open the `rekordbox xml` sidebar tree → `CDJ-safe (MP3)/<playlist>-CDJ-safe`.
3. Right-click the imported tracks → **Import to Collection**. Cues and beatgrid come with them — no re-analysis needed.
4. Export the playlist to USB in EXPORT mode as usual.

### Checking a playlist first (`--check`)

```sh
baken cdjsafe ~/Music/rekordbox/collection.xml --playlist "Sets/Friday" --check
```

Probes every track and prints, per track, what a pre-NXS2 player (CDJ-2000NXS, CDJ-900NXS), a CDJ-2000NXS2 and a CDJ-3000 will do with it: ✓ within the formats the player's operating instructions list, ✗ outside them (with the reason, such as FLAC on a pre-NXS2 player, a 32-bit float WAV, or a 192 kHz file), and ? where the manual says nothing (mono or multichannel files, `WAVE_FORMAT_EXTENSIBLE` WAVs, AIFF-C, VBR MP3 without a Xing header). A summary line per player follows, such as "3 of 42 tracks will not play on a pre-NXS2 player". Nothing is written and `--out-dir` is not needed. The exit code is 1 when a player refuses a track or a track is missing or unreadable, so a script can run it before an export.

The tables come from Pioneer's own operating instructions only, never from another tool's table; each one is cited in `crates/baken-core/src/cdjsafe/matrix.rs`. The CDJ-2000NXS2, for instance, lists WAV, AIFF, Apple Lossless and FLAC at up to 96 kHz from USB, while the CDJ-3000 lists MP3 and AAC at 44.1 and 48 kHz only. Every manual also says that some files do not play even in a supported format, so ✓ means "within the list", not a guarantee. `--check` only reports: a conversion still converts the whole playlist.

MP3 and AAC tracks are also decoded to see where their audio stops. An encoder low-passes what its bitrate cannot pay for (LAME at about 17 kHz for 128 kbps, 19.5 kHz for 256 and 20 kHz for 320), and re-encoding at a higher bitrate keeps the lower cutoff, so a "320" made from a 128 kbps file has nothing above 17 kHz. A track of 256 kbps or more with nothing above 19 kHz, or of 192 kbps or more with nothing above 17 kHz, is listed with the measured frequency as likely transcoded from a lower bitrate ([#222](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/222)). That is a measurement, not a verdict: some masters have little top end, so listen before deciding. It never changes the exit code, and nothing is skipped or converted because of it. Decoding costs about half a second of CPU per lossy track, spread over all cores: a 1374-track playlist with 533 MP3 and AAC files took 35 s instead of 8.

### Usage

```
baken cdjsafe <XML> --playlist <PATH> --out-dir <DIR> [-o <PATH>]
baken cdjsafe <XML> --playlist <PATH> --check
```

| Argument / Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `<XML>` | Exported rekordbox XML (required) |
| `--playlist <PATH>` | Playlist to convert (required). Top-level: just the name; nested: `Folder/Playlist` |
| `--out-dir <DIR>` | Directory for the MP3 files (required unless `--check`; created if missing) |
| `--output <PATH>` (`-o`) | Output XML path. Defaults to `<input-stem>-out.<ext>` next to the input |
| `--check` | Write nothing; report what each class of player does with every track (see above) |

### Notes

- The output profile is locked (320 kbps CBR / 44.1 kHz / ID3v2.3) — it's the only combination that plays reliably across the whole CDJ fleet, and CBR sidesteps rekordbox's VBR cue-offset problem.
- ffmpeg writes a valid Xing/LAME header, so rekordbox compensates the LAME encoder delay and cues stay sample-aligned.
- Filenames are FAT32/exFAT-sanitized; collisions get a numeric suffix.
- Requires ffmpeg (with `libmp3lame`; `soxr` resampling is used when available).

## Direct USB Export (`baken expressport`)

*Added in v3.5.0 as a beta, out of beta since v4.3.0. The output is byte-checked against real rekordbox exports (design record: [#115](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/115)), and testers have played sticks written by `baken` on a CDJ-3000 (firmware 3.22) and on CDJ-2000NXS2 players (1.85 and 1.87): playlists, beat grid, waveforms, cues, keys, search and My Settings, with copied and with generated analysis ([#116](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/116), where further player reports are welcome). As with any stick, check it on a player before a gig.*

`expressport` writes the USB stick itself, straight from your exported `collection.xml`: the device library (`export.pdb`), the analysis files (`PIONEER/USBANLZ`), the audio under `Contents/`, and your CDJ/DJM My Settings. No rekordbox launch, no re-import, no waiting for analysis. rekordbox's own database is never read. The USB Export page in [Bake'n Deck for Mac](#baken-deck-for-mac) (1.2.0 and later) runs this same export in a window.

```bash
baken expressport ~/Music/rekordbox/collection.xml --device /Volumes/MYUSB --playlist "Sets/Friday" --playlist "Sets/Warmup"
```

### How it works

- Title, artist, BPM, key, colour, rating, playlists, beat grid and cues all come from the XML. The key is shown on the player the way the XML spells it, as on a stick rekordbox exports: Classic `Am` stays `Am`, Alphanumeric `8A` stays `8A` (up to 4.1.1 a Classic key was left blank). Hot cues keep the colour set in rekordbox: each of its 16 hot cue colours goes onto the stick with the colour code and colour bytes rekordbox itself writes for it ([#236](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/236)); up to 4.4.0 every colour but green went out as code 0.
- Active loops (a memory loop the player starts by itself when playback reaches it) have no field in the XML, so a memory loop whose name starts with `[active]` (in any case) becomes the track's active loop, as in `[active] Build`; the marker is left out of the comment the player shows ([#210](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/210)). A player takes one active loop per track: when several memory loops are marked, the earliest is used and the plan says so. rekordbox's own XML does not say which loop is active, so a loop set active in rekordbox needs the marker in its comment as well.
- Waveforms are copied, not computed: every track should have been analysed in rekordbox once, and its `.DAT`/`.EXT`/`.2EX` files are copied from rekordbox's local analysis cache (`~/Library/Pioneer/rekordbox/share/PIONEER/USBANLZ`, or `PIONEER/Master/share/PIONEER/USBANLZ` on a library drive). On the way the path is rewritten, the cue sections are filled from the XML and the phrase analysis is masked exactly as rekordbox does at export time. Tracks with no analysis are listed and left out. A FLAC's seek table in that analysis points at byte offsets in the file rekordbox analysed, so `expressport` checks it against the file and, when the file has changed since (a `baken headroom` run re-encodes FLAC), rebuilds it from the file the way rekordbox writes it; the plan lists those tracks ([#219](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/219)).
- `--generate-analysis` computes the analysis files from the audio instead, for tracks rekordbox has never seen (a Mixxx or Traktor library converted to `collection.xml`, or a machine without rekordbox). The beat grid and the cues come from the XML as always, so a track whose XML has no `TEMPO` gets no beat grid (the plan says how many; the player then detects the BPM while playing, and quantize and beat sync cannot use it); the waveforms are decoded and measured by `baken` ([#147](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/147)). The scrolling waveform reproduces rekordbox's own to the pixel on the tracks it was checked against; the colour, three-band and preview waveforms are close approximations. Phrase analysis cannot be generated and is left out. Tracks that do have a rekordbox analysis are still copied, because copying is exact.
- Audio is copied only when missing or of a different size, so re-running after a playlist change is quick. `export.pdb` is rebuilt every run.
- The My Settings files `MYSETTING.DAT`, `MYSETTING2.DAT` and `DJMMYSETTING.DAT` are copied from rekordbox's settings directory into `PIONEER/` on the stick (not its root; that is where rekordbox puts them too) and are **required** unless `--no-settings` is given, which writes none so the player keeps its own settings (what a DJ without rekordbox usually wants from a club's CDJs). rekordbox writes them once Preferences > DJ System > My Settings has been opened, a page that only exists in EXPORT mode. `DEVSETTING.DAT` is copied too when it is there; players write their own, and a real rekordbox 7 export does not always carry it.
- `--cdjsafe` transcodes every track to 320 kbps CBR MP3 on the way and ships it with the source track's analysis, for pre-NXS2 players.

### Usage

```
baken expressport <XML> --device <DIR> [--playlist <PATH>]... [--anlz-dir <DIR>]... [--settings-dir <DIR> | --no-settings] [--device-name <NAME>] [--generate-analysis] [--cdjsafe] [--prune] [--dry-run]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--device <DIR>` | Root of the stick (required) |
| `--playlist <PATH>` | Playlist to export; repeatable. Omitted: every TrackID-referenced playlist |
| `--anlz-dir <DIR>` | rekordbox analysis directory when auto-detection fails |
| `--settings-dir <DIR>` | Directory holding the `*SETTING.DAT` files (default: rekordbox's own) |
| `--no-settings` | Write no My Settings; the player keeps its own settings |
| `--device-name <NAME>` | Name shown on the player (default: the stick's directory name) |
| `--generate-analysis` | Compute the analysis files from the audio for tracks with no rekordbox analysis (grid and cues still from the XML; no phrase data) |
| `--cdjsafe` | 320 kbps CBR MP3 for every track (needs ffmpeg) |
| `--prune` | Delete audio and analysis on the stick this export no longer references |
| `--dry-run` | Resolve and report, write nothing |

### Notes

- **A rekordbox install is normally required**, on the same machine or on an attached library drive: the waveforms and the My Settings files are copied from rekordbox's own. A `collection.xml` produced by another tool (Mixxx, Traktor, a converter) needs `--generate-analysis` for the waveforms (see [#145](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/145) and [#147](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/147)) and either `--settings-dir` pointing at the `*SETTING.DAT` files from any stick rekordbox once exported, or `--no-settings`; nothing in the XML can stand in for the settings.
- Built into the binaries; `cargo install baken --no-default-features` leaves it out.
- Legacy device library only (`export.pdb`): CDJ-3000, CDJ-2000NXS2, XDJ-XZ and older. Players that need OneLibrary (`exportLibrary.db`: CDJ-3000X, XDJ-AZ, OPUS-QUAD, OMNIS-DUO) are not supported yet.
- Format the stick as **FAT32 with an MBR partition table**. A CDJ-2000NXS2 or older reads neither exFAT nor a GPT disk and does not show such a stick at all; a CDJ-3000 also reads exFAT. The players' manuals also list FAT16 and HFS+. `expressport` reads the stick's filesystem and partition table before writing and warns when they rule out a player (macOS and Linux; on macOS the partition table comes from `diskutil`, on Linux from `lsblk`), and on macOS also when an HFS+ stick is case-sensitive, which AlphaTheta says might not be recognised.
- **HFS+ on a Mac** (Disk Utility: Mac OS Extended (Journaled), scheme Master Boot Record) writes faster, but no player has been tested with a stick written that way yet ([#221](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/221)). macOS writes HFS+ itself, while FAT32 goes through FSKit on macOS 26. On a SanDisk USB 3.2 stick, a 62-track, 3.3 GB playlist took 260 s on HFS+ against 423 to 438 s on FAT32, and a 527-track, 7 GB one 469 to 567 s against 1324 to 1362 s, with a quarter to a half of the writes reaching the stick and the same files on both. The directory and the three analysis files each track needs cost about 450 ms on FAT32 and almost nothing on HFS+. HFS+ also keeps file metadata itself, so no `._` files are written. Its limits: Windows cannot read or write it without extra software; the XDJ-R1, the first XDJ-RX and the CDJ-400 list FAT16 and FAT32 only (every other player manual checked lists HFS+); a case-sensitive one might not be recognised; and HFS+ stores accented and kana names decomposed (NFD) while `export.pdb` holds them composed (NFC). Until a player report confirms it, FAT32 is the safe choice.
- Use a stick dedicated to `expressport`; it is not meant to be layered over a stick rekordbox wrote. A stick rekordbox exported to loses its OneLibrary (`exportLibrary.db`, with `-wal` and `-shm`) and `exportExt.pdb` when `expressport` writes it, since they would go on describing rekordbox's library instead of the one just written: rekordbox reports that as a library inconsistency, and OneLibrary players would show the old library ([#208](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/208)). The plan (and `--dry-run`) lists them before anything is written. Files players leave behind (`PIONEER/CDJ`, `RBFLTR.DAT`, ...) are never touched.
- **How long it takes**: an export runs at the stick's write speed, plus about 0.4 s per track for the directory and the three analysis files the format wants next to each audio file (measured on macOS 26 with a FAT32 stick: a new directory 150 ms, a file create 27 ms, a write and close 25 ms). A USB 3 stick that writes 25 MB/s needs about 40 s per GB, and many sticks slow down once warm: a 62-track, 3.3 GB playlist took 339 s on a cold stick and about 450 s later, and `cp -R` of the same files took 410 to 533 s. `--cdjsafe` adds the encoding, a few seconds per track ([#197](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/197)). On Linux, check the mount options: udisks2 mounts FAT sticks with `flush`, which sends every closed file to the device at once, and cheap sticks are slow at that ([#173](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/173)).
- Check a finished stick on a player, not by opening it in rekordbox: rekordbox rewrites a device library it opens, and even changes a stick that is only mounted while it runs. [rbsync](https://github.com/aquarazorda/rbsync) measured it deleting 768 of 5,825 playlist entries from a stick it opened and adding an `exportLibrary.db`. If that happened, run `expressport` again: it rewrites `export.pdb` and removes the `exportLibrary.db`.
- On macOS 26, which mounts ExFAT and FAT sticks through FSKit, the files on the stick keep the NFC names rekordbox puts in `export.pdb`, and Terminal's `rm` cannot remove files under such names ([#154](https://github.com/M-Igashi/baken/issues/154)); Finder and `--prune` can.
- Artwork is not exported yet.
